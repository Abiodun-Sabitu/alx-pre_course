## My first README
This is my first dummy project as a student of ALX.
It is exposing me to the basics of how to work with Git and Github.
I have pratically practiced how to create a repo, manipulate local files and directories.
How to create a branch
How to commit and render commit messages
How to push to origin and pull from origin.
